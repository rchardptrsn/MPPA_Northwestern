Extension of Compliance Date for Entry-Level Driver Training,Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,"FMCSA finalizes its February 4, 2020 interim final rule (interim rule), which revised a December 8, 2016, final rule, ``Minimum Training Requirements for Entry-Level Commercial Motor Vehicle Operators'' (ELDT final rule). This action finalizes the extension of the compliance date for the ELDT final rule from February 7, 2020, to February 7, 2022. This action provides FMCSA additional time to complete development of the Training Provider Registry (TPR) and provides State Driver Licensing Agencies (SDLAs) time to modify their information technology (IT) systems and procedures, as necessary, to accommodate their receipt of driver-specific ELDT data from the TPR.", 2021-13893,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/30/2021-13893/extension-of-compliance-date-for-entry-level-driver-training,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-06-30/pdf/2021-13893.pdf,06/30/2021
Phasedown of Hydrofluorocarbons: Establishing the Allowance Allocation and Trading Program Under the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency is issuing regulations to implement certain provisions of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, as enacted on December 27, 2020. This Act mandates the phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons, which are highly potent greenhouse gases, by 85 percent over a period ending in 2036. The Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency to implement the phasedown by issuing a fixed quantity of transferrable production and consumption allowances, which producers and importers of hydrofluorocarbons must hold in quantities equal to the amount of hydrofluorocarbons they produce or import. To establish the allowance allocation program, this rulemaking determines the hydrofluorocarbon production and consumption baselines, from which allowed production and consumption will decrease consistent with the statutory phasedown schedule; provides an initial approach to allocating calendar-year allowances and allowing for the transfer of those allowances; establishes provisions for the international transfer of allowances; and establishes recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Additionally, it establishes provisions to support implementation, compliance with, and enforcement of, statutory and regulatory requirements under the Act's phasedown provisions. Over the time period from 2022-2050, this rulemaking will avoid cumulative emissions of 4,560 million metric tons of exchange value equivalent of HFCs in the United States with a present value of cumulative net benefits of $272.7 billion.", 2021-21030,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/05/2021-21030/phasedown-of-hydrofluorocarbons-establishing-the-allowance-allocation-and-trading-program-under-the,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-10-05/pdf/2021-21030.pdf,10/05/2021
Revised Cross-State Air Pollution Rule Update for the 2008 Ozone NAAQS,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking this action to address interstate transport of ozone pollution under the ``good neighbor provision'' of the Clean Air Act (CAA). This final action is taken in response to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's (D.C. Circuit) remand of the Cross- State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Update in Wisconsin v. EPA on September 13, 2019. The CSAPR Update finalized Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) for 22 states to address their good neighbor obligations for the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The D.C. Circuit found that the CSAPR Update, which was published on October 26, 2016 as a partial remedy to address upwind states' obligations prior to the 2018 Moderate area attainment date under the 2008 ozone NAAQS, was unlawful to the extent it allowed those states to continue their significant contributions to downwind ozone problems beyond the statutory dates by which downwind states must demonstrate their attainment of the air quality standards. On the same grounds, the D.C. Circuit also vacated the CSAPR Close-Out in New York v. EPA on October 1, 2019. This final rule resolves 21 states' outstanding interstate ozone transport obligations with respect to the 2008 ozone NAAQS. This action finds that for 9 of the 21 states for which the CSAPR Update was found to be only a partial remedy (Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wisconsin), their projected ozone precursor emissions in the 2021 ozone season and thereafter do not significantly contribute to a continuing downwind nonattainment and/or maintenance problem, and therefore the states' CSAPR Update FIPs (or the SIPs subsequently approved to replace certain states' CSAPR Update FIPs) fully address their interstate ozone transport obligations with respect to the 2008 ozone NAAQS. This action also finds that for the 12 remaining states (Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia), their projected 2021 ozone season nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) emissions significantly contribute to downwind states' nonattainment and/or maintenance problems for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. In this final action, EPA is issuing new or amended FIPs for these 12 states to replace their existing CSAPR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Group 2 emissions budgets for electricity generating units (EGUs) with revised budgets via a new CSAPR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Group 3 Trading Program. EPA is requiring implementation of the revised emission budgets beginning with the 2021 ozone season. Based on EPA's assessment of remaining air quality issues and additional emission control strategies for EGUs and other emissions sources in other industry sectors (non-EGUs), EPA is further determining that these NO<INF>X</INF> emission reductions fully eliminate these states' significant contributions to downwind air quality problems for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. In this action, EPA is also finalizing an error correction of its June 2018 approval of Kentucky's good neighbor SIP.", 2021-05705,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/04/30/2021-05705/revised-cross-state-air-pollution-rule-update-for-the-2008-ozone-naaqs,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-04-30/pdf/2021-05705.pdf,04/30/2021

Cross-State Air Pollution Rule Update for the 2008 Ozone NAAQS,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the original Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (original CSAPR) on August 8, 2011, to address interstate transport of ozone pollution under the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and interstate transport of fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) pollution under the 1997 and 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. The EPA is finalizing this Cross-State Air Pollution Rule Update (CSAPR Update) to address interstate transport of ozone pollution with respect to the 2008 ozone NAAQS. This final rule will benefit human health and welfare by reducing ground-level ozone pollution. In particular, it will reduce ozone season emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) in 22 eastern states that can be transported downwind as NO<INF>X</INF> or, after transformation in the atmosphere, as ozone, and can negatively affect air quality and public health in downwind areas. For these 22 eastern states, the EPA is issuing Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) that generally provide updated CSAPR NO<INF>X</INF> ozone season emission budgets for the electric generating units (EGUs) within these states, and that implement these budgets via modifications to the CSAPR NO<INF>X</INF> ozone season allowance trading program that was established under the original CSAPR. The EPA is finalizing these new or revised FIP requirements only for certain states that have failed to submit an approvable State Implementation Plan (SIP) addressing interstate emission transport for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. The FIPs require affected EGUs in each covered state to reduce emissions to comply with program requirements beginning with the 2017 ozone season (May 1 through September 30). This final rule partially addresses the EPA's obligation under the Clean Air Act to promulgate FIPs to address interstate emission transport for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. In conjunction with other federal and state actions to reduce ozone pollution, these requirements will assist downwind states in the eastern United States with attaining and maintaining the 2008 ozone NAAQS. This CSAPR Update also is intended to address the July 28, 2015 remand by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit of certain states' original CSAPR phase 2 ozone season NO<INF>X</INF> emission budgets. In addition, this rule updates the status of certain states' outstanding interstate ozone transport obligations with respect to the 1997 ozone NAAQS, for which the original CSAPR provided a partial remedy.", 2016-22240,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/10/26/2016-22240/cross-state-air-pollution-rule-update-for-the-2008-ozone-naaqs,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-10-26/pdf/2016-22240.pdf,10/26/2016

Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing a new subpart that updates the Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills (Emission Guidelines). The EPA reviewed the landfills Emission Guidelines based on changes in the landfills industry since the Emission Guidelines were promulgated in 1996. The EPA's review of the Emission Guidelines for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills considered landfills that accepted waste after November 8, 1987, and commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before July 17, 2014. Based on this review, the EPA has determined that it is appropriate to revise the Emission Guidelines to reflect changes to the population of landfills and the results of an analysis of the timing and methods for reducing emissions. This action will achieve additional reductions in emissions of landfill gas and its components, including methane, by lowering the emissions threshold at which a landfill must install controls. This action also incorporates new data and information received in response to an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking and a proposed rulemaking and addresses other regulatory issues including surface emissions monitoring, wellhead monitoring, and the definition of landfill gas treatment system. The revised Emission Guidelines, once implemented through revised state plans or a revised federal plan, will reduce emissions of landfill gas, which contains both nonmethane organic compounds and methane. Landfills are a significant source of methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas pollutant.

Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"This final rule, promulgated under the Clean Water Act (CWA), protects public health and the environment from toxic metals and other harmful pollutants, including nutrients, by strengthening the technology-based effluent limitations guidelines and standards (ELGs) for the steam electric power generating industry. Steam electric power plants contribute the greatest amount of all toxic pollutants discharged to surface waters by industrial categories regulated under the CWA. The pollutants discharged by this industry can cause severe health and environmental problems in the form of cancer and non-cancer risks in humans, lowered IQ among children, and deformities and reproductive harm in fish and wildlife. Many of these pollutants, once in the environment, remain there for years. Due to their close proximity to these discharges and relatively high consumption of fish, some minority and low-income communities have greater exposure to, and are therefore at greater risk from, pollutants in steam electric power plant discharges. The final rule establishes the first nationally applicable limits on the amount of toxic metals and other harmful pollutants that steam electric power plants are allowed to discharge in several of their largest sources of wastewater. On an annual basis, the rule reduces the amount of toxic metals, nutrients, and other pollutants that steam electric power plants are allowed to discharge by 1.4 billion pounds; it reduces water withdrawal by 57 billion gallons; and, it has social costs of $480 million and monetized benefits of $451 to $566 million.", 2015-25663,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/11/03/2015-25663/effluent-limitations-guidelines-and-standards-for-the-steam-electric-power-generating-point-source,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2015-11-03/pdf/2015-25663.pdf,11/03/2015

Pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), as amended, DOE must assess whether the uniform national standards for these covered equipment need to be updated each time the corresponding industry standard--the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)/ Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) Standard 90.1 (ASHRAE Standard 90.1)--is amended, which most recently occurred on October 9, 2013. Under EPCA, DOE may only adopt more stringent standards if there is clear and convincing evidence showing that more stringent amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would save a significant additional amount of energy. The levels DOE is adopting are the same as the efficiency levels specified in ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013. DOE has determined that the ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013 efficiency levels for the equipment types listed above are more stringent than existing Federal energy conservation standards and will result in economic and energy savings compared existing energy conservation standards. Furthermore, DOE has concluded that clear and convincing evidence does not exist that would justify more-stringent standard levels than the efficiency levels in ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013 for any of the equipment classes. DOE has also determined that the standards for small three-phase commercial air-cooled air conditioners (split system) do not need to be amended.

"Standards of Performance for New Residential Wood Heaters, New Residential Hydronic Heaters and Forced-Air Furnaces",Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to revise the Standards of Performance for New Residential Wood Heaters and to add a new subpart: Standards of Performance for New Residential Hydronic Heaters and Forced-Air Furnaces. Today's rule is authorized by section 111(b) and section 114 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The EPA is not finalizing, at this time, the proposed Standards of Performance for New Residential Masonry Heaters in order to allow additional time for the Masonry Heater Association to finish their efforts to develop revised test methods, an emissions calculation program and an alternative dimensioning standard. This final rule achieves several objectives for new residential wood heaters, including applying updated emission limits that reflect the current best systems of emission reduction; eliminating exemptions over a broad suite of residential wood combustion devices; strengthening test methods as appropriate; and streamlining the certification process. Residential wood smoke emissions are a significant national air pollution problem and human health issue. These emissions occur in many neighborhoods across the country, including minority and low-income neighborhoods, and impact people in their homes. To the extent that children and other sensitive populations are particularly susceptible to asthma, and that minority populations and low-income populations are more vulnerable, this rule will significantly reduce the pollutants that adversely affect their health. On an economic basis, the public benefits of this rule vastly outweigh the costs, with every dollar in additional cost producing more than $100 in public benefit. This final action does not include any requirements for heaters solely fired by gas, oil or coal. In addition, it does not include any new requirements associated with appliances that are already in use. The EPA continues to strongly encourage state, local, tribal, industry and consumer efforts to change out (replace) older heaters with newer, cleaner, more efficient heaters. Additional information is on the EPA Burn Wise Web site at www.epa.gov/burnwise. Also, we encourage state, local, and tribal authorities to develop site-specific installation and operating requirements to help ensure healthy air for all.", 2015-03733,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/03/16/2015-03733/standards-of-performance-for-new-residential-wood-heaters-new-residential-hydronic-heaters-and,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2015-03-16/pdf/2015-03733.pdf,03/16/2015

National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System-Final Regulations To Establish Requirements for Cooling Water Intake Structures at Existing Facilities and Amend Requirements at Phase I Facilities,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The purpose of this action is to reduce impingement and entrainment of fish and other aquatic organisms at cooling water intake structures used by certain existing power generation and manufacturing facilities for the withdrawal of cooling water from waters of the United States. This rule establishes requirements under section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) for existing power generating facilities and existing manufacturing and industrial facilities that are designed to withdraw more than 2 million gallons per day (mgd) of water from waters of the United States and use at least 25 percent of the water they withdraw exclusively for cooling purposes. These national requirements, which will be implemented through National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits, apply to the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures (CWIS) at regulated facilities and provide requirements that reflect the best technology available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impact. On April 20, 2011, EPA published a proposed rule that included several options for addressing these impacts. Subsequently, EPA published two Notices of Data Availability (NODA), on June 11, 2012 and June 12, 2012, that further clarified EPA's proposed approach. This final rule also responds to judicial remand of aspects of the previously promulgated Phase II and Phase III section 316(b) rules. In addition, EPA is also responding to an earlier judicial decision by removing from the previously promulgated Phase I new facility rule a restoration-based compliance alternative and the associated monitoring and demonstration requirements.", 2014-12164,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/08/15/2014-12164/national-pollutant-discharge-elimination-system-final-regulations-to-establish-requirements-for,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2014-08-15/pdf/2014-12164.pdf,08/15/2014

Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency; Transportation Department; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,"EPA and NHTSA, on behalf of the Department of Transportation, are each finalizing rules to establish a comprehensive Heavy-Duty National Program that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption for on-road heavy-duty vehicles, responding to the President's directive on May 21, 2010, to take coordinated steps to produce a new generation of clean vehicles. NHTSA's final fuel consumption standards and EPA's final carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>) emissions standards are tailored to each of three regulatory categories of heavy-duty vehicles: Combination Tractors; Heavy-duty Pickup Trucks and Vans; and Vocational Vehicles. The rules include separate standards for the engines that power combination tractors and vocational vehicles. Certain rules are exclusive to the EPA program. These include EPA's final hydrofluorocarbon standards to control leakage from air conditioning systems in combination tractors, and pickup trucks and vans. These also include EPA's final nitrous oxide (N<INF>2</INF>O) and methane (CH<INF>4</INF>) emissions standards that apply to all heavy- duty engines, pickup trucks and vans. EPA's final greenhouse gas emission standards under the Clean Air Act will begin with model year 2014. NHTSA's final fuel consumption standards under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 will be voluntary in model years 2014 and 2015, becoming mandatory with model year 2016 for most regulatory categories. Commercial trailers are not regulated in this phase of the Heavy-Duty National Program. The agencies estimate that the combined standards will reduce CO<INF>2</INF> emissions by approximately 270 million metric tons and save 530 million barrels of oil over the life of vehicles sold during the 2014 through 2018 model years, providing over $7 billion in net societal benefits, and $49 billion in net societal benefits when private fuel savings are considered. EPA is also finalizing provisions allowing light-duty vehicle manufacturers to use CO<INF>2</INF> credits to meet the light-duty vehicle N<INF>2</INF>O and CH<INF>4</INF> standards, technical amendments to the fuel economy provisions for light-duty vehicles, and a technical amendment to the criteria pollutant emissions requirements for certain switch locomotives.", 2011-20740,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/09/15/2011-20740/greenhouse-gas-emissions-standards-and-fuel-efficiency-standards-for-medium--and-heavy-duty-engines,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2011-09-15/pdf/2011-20740.pdf,09/15/2011

Federal Implementation Plans: Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone and Correction of SIP Approvals,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"In this action, EPA is limiting the interstate transport of emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) that contribute to harmful levels of fine particle matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) and ozone in downwind states. EPA is identifying emissions within 27 states in the eastern United States that significantly affect the ability of downwind states to attain and maintain compliance with the 1997 and 2006 fine particulate matter national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and the 1997 ozone NAAQS. Also, EPA is limiting these emissions through Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) that regulate electric generating units (EGUs) in the 27 states. This action will substantially reduce adverse air quality impacts in downwind states from emissions transported across state lines. In conjunction with other federal and state actions, it will help assure that all but a handful of areas in the eastern part of the country achieve compliance with the current ozone and PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS by the deadlines established in the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act). The FIPs may not fully eliminate the prohibited emissions from certain states with respect to the 1997 ozone NAAQS for two remaining downwind areas and EPA is committed to identifying any additional required upwind emission reductions and taking any necessary action in a future rulemaking. In this action, EPA is also modifying its prior approvals of certain State Implementation Plan (SIP) submissions to rescind any statements that the submissions in question satisfy the interstate transport requirements of the CAA or that EPA's approval of the SIPs affects our authority to issue interstate transport FIPs with respect to the 1997 fine particulate and 1997 ozone standards for 22 states.

Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Changes to Renewable Fuel Standard Program,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"Under the Clean Air Act Section 211(o), as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), the Environmental Protection Agency is required to promulgate regulations implementing changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard program. The revised statutory requirements specify the volumes of cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that must be used in transportation fuel. This action finalizes the regulations that implement the requirements of EISA, including the cellulosic, biomass- based diesel, advanced biofuel, and renewable fuel standards that will apply to all gasoline and diesel produced or imported in 2010. The final regulations make a number of changes to the current Renewable Fuel Standard program while retaining many elements of the compliance and trading system already in place. This final rule also implements the revised statutory definitions and criteria, most notably the new greenhouse gas emission thresholds for renewable fuels and new limits on renewable biomass feedstocks. This rulemaking marks the first time that greenhouse gas emission performance is being applied in a regulatory context for a nationwide program. As mandated by the statute, our greenhouse gas emission assessments consider the full lifecycle emission impacts of fuel production from both direct and indirect emissions, including significant emissions from land use changes. In carrying out our lifecycle analysis we have taken steps to ensure that the lifecycle estimates are based on the latest and most up-to-date science. The lifecycle greenhouse gas assessments reflected in this rulemaking represent significant improvements in analysis based on information and data received since the proposal. However, we also recognize that lifecycle GHG assessment of biofuels is an evolving discipline and will continue to revisit our lifecycle analyses in the future as new information becomes available. EPA plans to ask the National Academy of Sciences for assistance as we move forward. Based on current analyses we have determined that ethanol from corn starch will be able to comply with the required greenhouse gas (GHG) threshold for renewable fuel. Similarly, biodiesel can be produced to comply with the 50% threshold for biomass-based diesel, sugarcane with the 50% threshold for advanced biofuel and multiple cellulosic-based fuels with their 60% threshold. Additional fuel pathways have also been determined to comply with their thresholds. The assessment for this rulemaking also indicates the increased use of renewable fuels will have important environmental, energy and economic impacts for our Nation.", 2010-3851,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2010/03/26/2010-3851/regulation-of-fuels-and-fuel-additives-changes-to-renewable-fuel-standard-program,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2010-03-26/pdf/2010-3851.pdf,03/26/2010

Average Fuel Economy Standards Passenger Cars and Light Trucks Model Year 2011,Rule,Transportation Department; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,"The future of this country's economy, security, and environment are linked to one key challenge: energy. To reduce fuel consumption, NHTSA has been issuing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards since the late 1970's under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). However, the principal effects of these standards are broader than their statutory purpose. Reducing fuel consumption conserves petroleum, a non-renewable energy source, saves consumers money, and promotes energy independence and security by reducing dependence on foreign oil. It also directly reduces the motor vehicle tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>), which is the principal greenhouse gas emitted by motor vehicles. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) amended EPCA by mandating that the model year (MY) 2011-2020 CAFE standards be set sufficiently high to ensure that the industry-wide average of all new passenger cars and light trucks, combined, is not less than 35 miles per gallon by MY 2020. This is a minimum requirement, as NHTSA must set standards at the maximum feasible level in each model year. NHTSA will determine, based on all of the relevant circumstances, whether that additional requirement calls for establishing standards that reach the 35 mpg goal earlier than MY 2020. NHTSA published a proposal in May 2008 to begin implementing EISA by establishing CAFE standards for MYs 2011-2015. A draft final rule for those model years was completed, but not issued. In the context of his calls for the development of new national policies to prompt sustained domestic and international actions to address the closely intertwined issues of energy independence, energy security and climate change, the President issued a memorandum on January 26, 2009, requesting NHTSA to divide its rulemaking into two parts. First, he requested the agency to issue a final rule adopting CAFE standards for MY 2011 only. Given the substantial time and analytical effort involved in developing CAFE standards and the limited amount of time before the statutory deadline of March 30, 2009 for establishing the MY 2011 standards, the agency has necessarily based this one year final rule almost wholly on the information available to it and the analysis performed by it in support of the draft final rule completed last fall. Second, the President requested NHTSA to establish standards for MY 2012 and later after considering the appropriate legal factors, the comments filed in response to the May 2008 proposal, the relevant technological and scientific considerations, and, to the extent feasible, a forthcoming report by the National Academy of Sciences, mandated under section 107 of EISA, assessing existing and potential automotive technologies and costs that can practicably be used to improve fuel economy. The deferral of action on standards for the later model years provides the agency with an opportunity to review its approach to CAFE standard setting, including its methodologies, economic and technological inputs and decisionmaking criteria, so as to ensure that it will produce standards that contribute, to the maximum extent possible within the limits of EPCA/EISA, to meeting the energy and environmental challenges and goals outlined by the President. NHTSA estimates that the MY 2011 standards will raise the industry- wide combined average to 27.3 mpg, save 887 million gallons of fuel over the lifetime of the MY 2011 cars and light trucks, and reduce CO<INF>2</INF> emissions by 8.3 million metric tons during that period.", E9-6839,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2009/03/30/E9-6839/average-fuel-economy-standards-passenger-cars-and-light-trucks-model-year-2011,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2009-03-30/pdf/E9-6839.pdf,03/30/2009
